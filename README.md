## **Technologies Used**
In this project, I utilized a modern Android development stack to ensure high-quality code and maintainability:
- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose** for building the UI
- **Splash Screen** for app launch splash
- **Retrofit** for networking
- **Coroutines** and **Flow** for asynchronous programming and data streams
- **Material3** design system for UI consistency
- **Androidx libraries** for lifecycle and architecture components
- **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Junit** for unit testing
- **Mock Web Server** for API testing
- **Turbine** for testing Flows
- **Mockk** for mocking
- **Assertk** for assertions
- **Ktlint** for code style and formatting
- **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration (CI)

## **UI Flow**
The app's UI adheres to modern design principles and provides an excellent user experience:
- Designed using **Material3** for a consistent look and feel.
- **Dark and Light Mode** support for better accessibility and user preference.
- **Android 12 Dynamic Color** support for seamless integration with the system theme.
- **Responsive Design** to support multiple devices and orientations with appropriate layouts.

## **Testing**
Extensive testing ensures reliability and robustness:
- **Unit Tests**: Validate components and logic.

---

## **Continuous Integration (CI)**
Implemented a CI pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to:
1. Build the project.
2. Check code formatting with **Ktlint**.
3. Check code analysis with **Detekt**.
4. Run tests.
